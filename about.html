<p class="mainText"> <img src="/Images/jeff_and_renee.jpg" alt="Picture of Jeff and Renee in a field." style="float:right;width:750px;height:500px">I was born and raised in Lenexa, KS, just outside of Kansas City. I attended high school at St. James Academy, where my senior year I began dating my future fiancee, Renee.
    After high school, I traveled to South Bend, Indiana to pursue my degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. 
    At Notre Dame, I began undergraduate research examining the use of optimization tools for enhanced human-robot interaction, specifically for rehabilitation following spinal cord injuries. 
    Impacting the world in this way brought great joy and peace, and I decided to continue academic research in the area of rehabilitative robotics after earning my BSME degree from Notre Dame.

<p class="mainText">
    I joined the Rice Computational Neuromechanics Lab (RCNL) and Mechatronic and Haptic Interface Lab (MAHI) at Rice University in August 2020. 
    With my work in these labs, I am gaining deeper knowledge in robotics, controls, biomechanics, and optimization while also continuing to research rehabilitative robotics.
